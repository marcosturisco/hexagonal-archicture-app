This project demonstrates the implementation of a system using various technologies to efficiently deliver features to the user while following best software development practices.
The application was developed over the following technologies and features:

üöÄ Technologies & Features:

Spring Boot for building the backend application.
Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.
Spring MVC for developing RESTful APIs.
Spring HATEOAS implemented to achieve Level 3 of the REST Maturity Model, enabling hypermedia-driven navigation between resources.
HTTP/2 Protocol with SSL enabled to enhance performance through multiplexed streams, header compression, and secure communication.
GraphQL Adapter implemented to provide a flexible and efficient alternative to REST, allowing clients to query exactly the data they need.

üì° New API Endpoints:

DELETE endpoint for removing animals.
Paginated listing with support for dynamic sorting.
Custom exception handling, such as a specific error response for failed animal creation.# Custom exception handling, such as a specific error response for failed animal creation.

üß™ Testing & Documentation:

BDD testing using the Cucumber Framework, with a refined suite of behavioral test scenarios.
Swagger (Springdoc OpenAPI) for API documentation and testing.
Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring and health checks.

‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure & Architecture:

Nginx as a reverse proxy, providing load balancing and added security.
MySQL as a relational database for persistent data storage.
Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) combined with DDD principles to ensure modularity, flexibility, and scalability.
iReports API for exporting database data into customized reports.
Integration with OpenAI API to retrieve animal species names based on descriptive input.
Maven for project build and dependency management.
Docker for containerizing the solution, ensuring portability and ease of deployment.
.env file support, allowing secure and flexible environment variable configuration for Docker environments.

This project serves as a practical guide for integrating these technologies in a real-world development environment.

# Docker Build & Compose
$ docker build -t dockermactur/spring:zoo .
$ docker build -t dockermactur/nginx:zoo nginx/.
$ docker compose --env-file .env up --build

# To generate the keystore file (Execute replacing the needed parameters)
$ keytool -genkeypair -alias your-key-alias \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 \
  -storetype PKCS12 \
  -keystore keystore.p12 \
  -validity 3650 \
  -storepass your-password

# To generate the .crt and .key files for HTTP/2 + SSL Protocol Test
$ openssl pkcs12 -in keystore.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out certificate.crt
$ openssl pkcs12 -in keystore.p12 -nocerts -nodes -out private.key
