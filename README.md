This project demonstrates the implementation of a system using various technologies to efficiently deliver features to the user while following best software development practices.
The application was developed in collaboration with the zoo team and utilizes the following technologies:

- Spring Boot for building the backend application.
- Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.
- Spring MVC for developing RESTful APIs.
- Nginx as a Reverse Proxy for load balancing and security.
- MySQL as a relational database for data storage.
- Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring and health checks of the application.
- Ports and Adapter (Hexagonal) Architecture and DDD concepts for modularity and system scalability.
- Swagger API for endpoint documentation and testing.
- iReports API for exporting database data into customized reports.
- Integration with OpenAI API to retrieve the species names of animals.
- Maven for dependency management and project build.
- Docker to run the solution in a containerized environment, ensuring portability and easy deployment.

This project serves as a practical guide for integrating these technologies in a real-world development environment.
